Reducing transparency will completely eliminate the stutter:
System Preferences - Accessibility - Display - Reduce transparency


Changing the background_opacity setting doesn't seem to have any effect on the stutter and even with "Reduce transparency" on, the background will still be transparent.

I'm on a 16-inch 2019 MacBook Pro, 2 GPUs, Intel UHD Graphics 630 (built-in) and AMD Radeon Pro 5300M (PCIe).

The automatic GPU switching in Big Sur really seems to be to blame. I ended up disabling automatic graphics switching at a system-wide level by going to System Preferences > Battery > Battery and unchecking Automatic graphics switching. Pour one out for my battery life 🍺, but my Alacritty experience is back to being speedy and amazing.
