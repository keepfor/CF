Speed is important, when factory has already started the production of a product. After factory reviews the cost of USW_Mission_Critircal's production, I aggressively strive to reduce the testing time of PoE tests of USW_Mission_Critircal. Host the communication bwteen test engineers and firmware engineers. And before make changes on my tools, I align the test engineers and firmware engineers to minimize the changes to the tools to reduce the risk to production, but also achieve the cost reduction for factory.

Being a user of our tools, I focus on making factory can use our tools easily. For the BLE CLI tools of USP_Battery, I study the win32 code page document, and develop/support different languages code settings to fix and cover the languages decoding issues when using BLE CLI tools. And not just want to lead the changes of my tools, I prioritize the experience of test engineers to the first.

It is important to make the testing time reduction, but sometimes we will usually need to do some retries. In the case of UISP-P, I notice the some sub-tests are not necessary to go, if the test has already failed. I recommend firmware team we can just return result, once some sub-tests failed and do not do retries in this scenario to reduce the testing time more. 

Most often when we talk about testing time reduction, we need to do trade off between efficiency and necessity. As part of software team of UI, I focus on the perspective of the sofeware and code level to impact other function team, and always beging proactive to listen other function teams' opinion, and mentor each other to get the better solution to our work.
