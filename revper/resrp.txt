2023 Performance Expectation ( Goals and Objectives )

===================================================================================
Act as a subject matter expert for automation tools. Take the ownship of the integration of automation tools and focus on enhancement of experience and performance. To identify the design, develop for automation tools and execute test plans efficiently.  

=========================================================================================
Output  (Describe the end goal(s) that you contribute to with this expectation)

* Coordinate the USP Battery FW RD and USP RPS FW RD to deal with USP Battery Burnin design, and quickly implement the tools as a POC. After the PLM rejected the original Burnin plan, we quickly figure out the planB and implement to meet the schedules.

* Participate in discussions with UISP HW, FW and TEs to resolve UACC-LTE automation tests timeout issues. Include reproducing issues and developing retry methodology to temporary improve retest rate. Also release hot fix to quickly help factory production, finally found out the vendor issues. 


=======================================================================================================
Working Principles ( Describe how you apply our  principles to your day to day work ) 

* Discuss actively and transparently with TE and RD team for the necessity of retries, as it will increase production cost. And using the decorator of Python, to create the retry class to cover all UISP Diag FW retry test issues, not just looping the test method to do retries.  

* Cowork and communicate with UISP FW team to discuss and design the Diag shell behaviors and common test cases log format, then align many UISP products and its Diag FW with different FW RDs, to make an efficient long-term strategy for reducing the effort of Development.

==========================================================================================================
Leadership (Describe what leadership behaviors you will show to achieve this expectation)

* Rather than discovering bugs after a feature has been shipped and scrambling to release a patch, always review and improve code to get the simpler implementation for RD team's test plan, and fullfill the TE's UI/UX.

* Like a Bredge between TE and RD team, transfer the TE and factory's opinions to RD team. And writing test plan for TE, also explain RD's cmd test plan to Testing Engineers to Sync two sides' Objectives to have a better understanding to each other. 

==========================================================================================================
Overall

* Become a pivotal role to communicate information across the teams and ensure the message is understood, sharing information and help remove bottlenecks and also keep everyone feeling like they are in the loop and empowered to make decisions. 

* Triage tools issues and debug/track/resolve by analyzing the sources of issues and the impact on hardware, network, or service operations and quality. And identify the design, develop for automation tools and execute test plans efficiently.
